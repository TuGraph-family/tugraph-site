Graph analysis engine, also known as graph computing framework, is mainly used for complex graph analysis. It is a technology that can run full data sets quickly and iteratively. Applicable scenarios include community discovery, gene sequence prediction, importance ranking, etc. Typical algorithms include PageRank, WCC, BFS, LPA and SSSP.

The TuGraph Community Edition has been open-sourced on Github in September 2022. This article will take a look at the technology of TuGraph graph analysis engine.

<p style="color: rgb(0, 82, 255); text-align:center;" >1 Overview of TuGraph Analysis Engine </p>

TuGraph's graph analysis engine, mainly used for full graph/full data analysis tasks. With TuGraph's C++ graph analysis engine API, users can quickly export a complex subgraph to be processed from different data sources, and then run iterative graph algorithms such as BFS, PageRank, LPA, WCC on the subgraph, and finally make decision or take action according to the results.
In TuGraph, both the subgraph export and analysis processes can be accelerated by parallel processing in memory, so as to achieve near real-time analysis. Compared with traditional methods, the cost of data export and placement can be avoided, and the compact graph data structure can be used to obtain the ideal performance of the calculation.

According to different data sources and implementations, it can be divided into three operating modes: Procedure, Embed and Standalone. The data sources for the Procedure pattern and the Embed pattern are loaded graph data in graph stores, which are suitable for Client/Server deployments, respectively, and direct server-side calls, Embed mode is mostly used for debugging.

Standalone mode uses external data sources, such as TXT, binary, and ODPS files, and run analytics algorithms independently of the storage of graph data..

TuGraph has six basic algorithms built into the community Edition and 34 algorithms built into the business edition. It covers six common methods, including graph structure, community detection, path finding, importance analysis, pattern mining and correlation analysis, which can meet the needs of various business scenarios, so users hardly need to realize the specific graph calculation process by themselves.

<div style="color: rgb(0, 82, 255); text-align:center;" >2 Function Description </div>

2.1 Graph analysis framework
As the "skeleton" of graph analysis engine, graph analysis framework can combine multiple modules to work together effectively. It is generally divided into three stages: preprocessing, algorithm process and result analysis.

The preprocessing part is used to read data and parameters for graph construction and related information storage statistics, and sort out the parameters and data required by the algorithm process.

The algorithm part will calculate the data obtained in the preprocessing process, and obtain the result data.

The result analysis part carries out personalized processing according to the obtained result data (such as taking the maximum value, etc.), and writes back important information and prints out.

2.2 Point edge filter
Point and edge filters operate on the Procedure and Embed modes in the graph analysis engine. For the graph storage data source, the graph data can be screened according to user needs and actual business scenarios, and the effective points and edges can be selected to construct the sub-graph structure.
2.3 Consistency Snapshot
The Procedure and Embed modes in TuGraph provide a "snapshot" of data, that is, creating a fully usable copy of a given data set that includes a mirror image of the corresponding data at a time (time at which the copy began). Because OLAP operations involve only reads and not writes, OlapOnDB arranges data in a more compact manner, saving space while improving the locality of data access.
2.4 Block Read/Write module
The block read/write module operates within the Standalone mode of the graph analysis engine for efficient reading of data from different external sources, as well as for writing back to the graph results that have been processed by internal algorithms.
2.5 Parameter Module
The parameter module operates in the Standalone mode of the analysis engine. It is used to accept and organize the general information of the graph (such as data source, algorithm name, data input and output paths, number of vertices, etc.) as well as different information parameters configured according to different data sources and algorithms, to transmit to the graph algorithm and individual modules. At the same time, the final result will be modular display.

<div style="color: rgb(0, 82, 255); text-align:center;" >3 Examples </div>

As mentioned above, the graph analysis engine has three modes: Procedure, Embed and Standalone. Now take the bfs algorithm as an example to introduce their usage.
3.1 Procedure Mode
Procedure mode is mainly used for loading and invoking graph algorithms when TuGraph runs in Client/Server mode.
Run bash make_so.sh bfs in the TuGraph/plugins directory to access the 'bfs.so' file in the TuGraph/plugins directory, upload the file as a plug-in to tugraph-web, enter parameters, and then execute.
Example:
Compile the.so algorithm file in TuGraph/plugins

`bash make_so.sh bfs`

After loading the 'bfs.so' file into TuGraph-web as a plug-in, enter the following json parameters:

![](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_qcdryc/afts/img/A*z3UvTZuz16kAAAAAAAAAAAAADgOBAQ/original)

You can get the return result.

Explanation of output content:
num_edges: indicates the number of edges on the graph
num_vertices: Indicates the number of data vertices in the diagram
prepare_cost: indicates the time required for the preprocessing stage. The work of preprocessing stage: loading parameters, graph loading, index initialization, etc.
core_cost: represents the time it takes the algorithm to run.
found_vertices: Indicates the number of vertices found.
output_cost: indicates the time required to write the algorithm result back to the db.
total_cost: indicates the total running time of the algorithm.
3.2 Embed Mode
This method is mainly used for TuGraph to analyze the algorithm of the pre-loaded graph stored data in the background program, and is mostly used for debugging. Complete the embed_main.cpp file in the TuGraph/plugins directory and add the data name, input parameters, and data path as shown in the following example:
![](https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_qcdryc/afts/img/A*IHYKSp80bdwAAAAAAAAAAAAADgOBAQ/original)

After saving the file, run bash make_so.sh bfs in the TuGraph/plugins directory to go to the bfs_procedure file in the TuGraph/plugins/cpp directory. bash make_embed

To get the result, run./cpp/bfs_procedure in the TuGraph/plugins folder.

3.3 Standalone Mode
The Standalone mode can run independently of the graph storage, reading the graph in Edgelist form directly from a text file or ODPS. In TuGraph/build directory make bfs_standalone can get bfs_standalone file, the file is generated with TuGraph/build/output/algo folder. Run: Run the following command in the TuGraph/build directory./output/algo/bfs_standalone - -- type [type] -- -input_dir [input_dir] - -- vertices [vertices] --root [root] -- -output_dir [output_dir]

- [type] : indicates the type source of the input graph file, including the text file, BINARY_FILE binary file, and ODPS source.

- [input_dir] : indicates the folder path of the input image file. The folder can contain one or more input files. When TuGraph reads input files, it reads all files under [input_dir]. Only input files can be included under [input_dir], and no other files can be included. The parameter cannot be omitted.

- [vertices] : Number of vertices in the diagram. If the value is 0, the user wants the system to automatically identify the number of vertices. If the value is non-zero, it indicates that the user wants to customize the number of vertices. The number of user-defined vertices must be greater than the maximum vertex ID. Parameter can be omitted. The default value is 0.

- [root] : indicates the id of the start vertex for bfs. The parameter cannot be omitted.

- [output_dir] : indicates the path of the folder where output data is saved. The parameter cannot be omitted.

Example: build the standalone algorithm in TuGraph/build

The result parameters are explained as above.

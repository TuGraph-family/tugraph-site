**The value of graph computing technology in financial anti-money laundering, risk control, KYC, stock recommendations and other fields is clear. As the most important basic software of graph computing technology, the selection of graph database plays a decisive role in the final effect of the project. **At present, there is no selection test tool for financial scenarios in the industry. As a result, financial institutions can only test the graph database based on their own scenario, or use some benchmark tests for non-financial scenarios (such as LDBC-SNB based on social networks, Twitter data set, etc.). Both of these methods have major drawbacks. The test based on its own scenes has limitations in data representation, scene algorithm and other aspects, because the actual usage scenario has not been completely determined during the selection, and only a part of the scenes, data and algorithms that can be "currently thought of" can be used for testing. Using social network-based benchmarking, on the other hand, creates the problem of scenario mismatch, because the data and algorithms of the social scenario are not consistent with those of the financial scenario.

In order to solve this problem, Ant Group proposed to the Linked Data Benchmark Committee(hereinafter referred to as LDBC) to design a graph database benchmark for financial scenarios. The benchmark was named LDBC-FinBench (hereinafter referred to as FinBench), which has been formally approved in LDBC. It is expected to be released in private beta by the end of 2022, with an official release in the second quarter of next year.

LDBC-FinBench project team is led by Ant Group, and 10 domestic and foreign graph computing technology enterprises and industry experts participate, including Intel, StarGraph, Create Link, Ultipa, Nebula and TigerGraph. Different from the LDBC-SNB test benchmark that focuses on social networking scenarios, FinBench simulates real data distribution and data query in financial scenarios to help understand the comprehensive performance of the system under test in financial scenarios, and provides professional and objective standards and tools for customers to select and purchase graph computing products.

After a lot of research and multiple rounds of discussion, the LDBC FinBench working group referred to a large number of domestic and foreign mature database test benchmark design methods and a large number of real business scenarios of Ant Group and different financial institutions. In June 2022, it released the benchmark specification (draft) and asked for comments, and iterated and enriched. We've received a lot of inquiries from customers, partners, and developers. People are generally concerned with graph models in FinBench and the associated Workloads of graph based queries. These aspects of FinBench design are highlighted below.

Data model design conforms to real financial scenarios </span></strong></span>

The LDBC FinBench data model is designed to reflect real data in the financial system. Common financial entities in the real system include Account, Medium, Person, Company and Loan. Entities are vertices, and edges reflect financial activity, such as the Transfer of funds from one account to another.

There are some significant differences between the data model of the financial scene and that of ordinary social networks. For example, there may be many transfer records between two accounts, which can be shown as multiple edges between two vertices in the graph model. The friendship in social network, however, is only a single side. In addition, in the financial scenario, the vertices have dynamic properties to mark the entity state. For example, an account can be marked blocked or unblocked, depending on the situation; The amount transferred varies greatly, so attributes such as the amount present in the edge of the transfer.

It should be emphasized that a timestamp attribute is added to many types of LDBC-FinBench data model, which is very important data in financial scenarios. The specific timing and sequence of transfers, deposits, loans, repayments, and even user logins, loan applications, company investments and guarantees all contain valuable information. Because of the added timestamp attribute, situations such as frequent operations at a specific time can also be effectively identified.

Online financial system in the data processing and analysis, will carry out a large number of read operations, write operations and read and write mixed operations. Considering the complexity of data access in the real world, FinBench also divides reads into simple reads and complex reads. The FinBench Specification (draft) details 14 complex read queries (TCR), 8 simple read queries (TSR), 14 write queries (TW), and 5 read/write mixed queries (TRW).

From the perspective of business in the financial field, there are many scenarios for these queries, including fund tracking, recognition of fund-raising withdrawal behavior, recognition of funds fast in and fast out, identification of transfer ring, routine accounting inspection, analysis of shareholding similarity, analysis of equity correlation, identification of guarantee ring, etc.

Let's take a few typical queries further (this is a test simulation, not a real business).

This query can identify if three accounts form a transfer loop. The transfer ring can effectively identify potential money laundering.

Money moves in and out of an account frequently, in similar amounts and over similar periods of time. When the risk control department gets the list of the accounts transferred in and out, it can make the next analysis and judgment.

<strong><span style=" max-width: 100%; clear: both; font-size: 10.5pt; text-align: justify;" >2.3 Identification of abnormal transfers through loans (TCR 9) </span></strong>

<p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: DengXian; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); white-space: normal; text-align: center; margin-top: 16px;" Word-wrap: break-word!Important; "><span style=" max-width: 100%; font-size: 10.5pt; text-align: justify;" </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt; text-align: justify;" >) </span></p>

This is a relatively covert abnormal transfer behavior, the **up** account transfers money to the **down** account through the **mid** account. If the transfer is direct, it is easy to identify the time and amount of the transfer. Some people will first lend money and deposit to **mid**, and then transfer to the **down**, and then transfer money to **mid** through **up**, and finally **mid** will repay the loan . In this scenario, all kinds of transactions (side time stamps) must meet the corresponding order (edge2 before edge4 before edge3 before edge1).

<strong><span style=" max-width: 100%; clear: both; font-size: 10.5pt; text-align: justify;" > 2.4 Block high risk accounts after transfer ring identification (TRW 1) </span></strong>

<p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: DengXian; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); white-space: normal; text-align: center; margin-top: 16px;" Word-wrap: break-word!Important; "><span style=" max-width: 100%; font-size: 10.5pt; text-align: justify;" </span></p> (Figure 5: Block high-risk accounts after the transfer ring is identified) </span>

This is a read/write combination query. After receiving a transfer request, the system first searches the status of blocked of the account. If the status is normal, the account is not transferred immediately. Instead, the transfer edge is inserted to check whether the transfer ring is formed in the graph after the new edge is added. If a transfer ring is formed, you can mark the account blacked.

This is a real-time scenario that identifies possible transfer risks before they occur. Rather than analyzing the data after the fact, marking accounts and recovering lost money can effectively protect accounts and transactions.

</strong>
</span>

The LDBC-FinBench data model and queries provide some abstraction of the financial scenario. The main purpose of benchmarking is to better measure the function and performance of the graph database and provide reference for procurement and research and development. **LDBC-FinBench is also an industry-level benchmark test for users in the financial industry. It will also play a role in drawing database application design and product innovation. **

**At present, FinBench work is still in progress. Interested organizations or individuals are welcome to join in the construction. Look forward to keeping an eye on LDBC-FinBench.**
